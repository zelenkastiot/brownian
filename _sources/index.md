Stohastic process | *Brownian motion*

<br> **Students**: Viktor Domazetoski, Pece Trajanovski, Kiril Zelenkovski

This Jupyter-book is a collection of some notebooks regarding the famous stohasic proces known 
as Brownian Motion. 
In this work we simulate Brownian motion by solving the Langevin equation numerically. 
We simulate the trajectory of a Brownian particle and plot the probability density function 
and the mean square displacement. We compare the simulation results with the analytical ones.
