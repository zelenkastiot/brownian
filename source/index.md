<br> **Project**: Diffusion and random search in heterogeneous media (pno. [452796171](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/452796171?language=en))
<br> **Project cordinator**: PhD. Trifce Sandev
<br> **Research associates**: Pece Trajanovski, Kiril Zelenkovski


A jupyter-book that explores mearly a chunk of the field of nonlinear dynamics, specifically diffusion and random search in heterogeneous media. The book has various simulations for the stochastic process known as Brownian motion. The motion dynamics are simulated by solving the Langevin equation numerically for the different initial parameters. After an ensemble finishes, the trajectories of Brownian particles together with the probability density function and the mean square displacement are plotted. The book has chapters on Brownian search, Backbone problems, and Stochastic resetting.
